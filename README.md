In this section, I have successfully completed a series of exercises ranging from 6.1 to 6.24.

Let's take a look at the key milestones I've achieved:

## Key Milestones

### 1. Flux Architecture and Redux

Learned about the Flux architecture and implemented state management using Redux. Explored the lightweight version of Redux directly supported by React, namely the React context and `useRedux` hook.

### 2. Redux Toolkit

Explored the Redux Toolkit, a set of opinionated utilities that simplify common Redux use cases. Gained insights into efficient state management in React applications.

### 3. Communicating with Server in a Redux Application

Understood the process of communicating with the server in a Redux application. Utilized Axios for making HTTP requests and efficiently managed server state.

### 4. React Query, useReducer, and Context

Integrated the React Query library into the application. Explored the useReducer and context API to streamline the management of server state.
